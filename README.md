# CashStash

A light weight money tracking application.

## Development

* Run "npm install" to install required dependencies
* Run "npm run build" to run the development build script - keep this running as it recompiles your code when changes are detected.
* Run "npm start" in a new terminal window - keep this running too, as it is your node server.
